          The 94th Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion
          Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), honored the best films released
          between March 1 and December 31, 2021, at the Dolby Theatre in Los
          Angeles on March 27, 2022. The ceremony was hosted by Regina Hall, Amy
          Schumer and Wanda Sykes. It was the first ceremony since the 83rd
          Academy Awards in 2011 to feature multiple hosts. each. Controversy
          ensued when actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris
          Rock in the face during the ceremony, after Rock made a joke about
          Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. The incident received heavy news
          coverage and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.

              <h3>Jane Campion</h3>
              <p>
                Jane Campion has won this year's best director Oscar for helming
                the Western drama The Power of the Dog. She is now the third
                director who is a woman to win an Oscar, following Kathryn
                Bigelow (in 2010 for The Hurt Locker) and Chloé Zhao (in 2021
                for Nomadland). Campion also wrote the screenplay based on
                Thomas Savage's 1967 novel of the same title. The story is set
                in 1925, about two Montana ranchers: Benedict Cumberbatch plays
                a cruel, complicated cowboy who is enraged when his brother
                (Jesse Plemons) brings home a wife (Kirsten Dunst) and her son
                (Kodi Smit-McPhee). All four were nominated for top acting
                Oscars.

              <h3>Will Smith</h3>
              <p>
                Will Smith has won the Oscar for best actor at the 94th Academy
                Awards, currently under way at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles.
                Smith won the prize for his role as Richard Williams, father of
                tennis champions Venus and Serena Williams, in King Richard, a
                biopic that outlined Williams’ role in the sisters’ stellar
                success. The film was directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green and
                stars Smith in the title role, alongside Aunjanue Ellis as his
                wife Brandy, Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton as Venus and
                Serena, and Jon Bernthal as tennis coach Rick Macci. Venus and
                Serena Williams acted as executive producers on the project.

              <h3>Jessica Chastain</h3>
              <p>
                Jessica Chastain is officially an Academy Award winner. At
                Sunday night’s Oscars 2022 ceremony, Chastain picked up the
                best-actress statuette for her performance in The Eyes of Tammy
                Faye, in which she portrayed the titular televangelist, Tammy
                Faye Bakker. In her speech, she thanked director Michael
                Showalter, costar Andrew Garfield, and the movie’s hair and
                makeup team, who won an Oscar themselves for transforming
                Chastain into Bakker. She then took a serious turn, noting how
                we as a culture “are coming out of some difficult times that
                have been filled with a lot of trauma and isolation.”

              <p><img src="img/will smith slap.jpg" alt="Will Smith attack"> Since then he has disappeared from public view; just sporadic appearances, but nothing of an official nature.

                But now it's emerging what Will Smith is up to, as he checked himself into a luxury rehab clinic to learn how to manage stress but then focused on his spirituality.
                
                A source consulted by US Weekly revealed the trip was a "family holiday that was already planned".
                
                "There had been talk of cancelling it, but Jada [Pinkett Smith] insisted," the source added.
                
                As a result, Smith "has been going to therapy after the Oscar incident," according to sources close to the actor after the event in which he stormed the stage and slapped Chris Rock for a joke directed at his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.
                
                Now they are joined by persistent rumours that their marriage has broken up.
                
                "There were problems between them for years, but now they barely speak to each other. The tensions between them have been palpable," sources tell Heat Magazine.

                One of the three hosts for this year’s ceremony, Amy Schumer, has said she is still “triggered and traumatised” by the incident, and “waiting for this sickening feeling to go away from what we all witnessed”.
                
                Writing on Instagram, Schumer added: “I love my friend [Chris Rock] and believe he handled it like a pro. Stayed up there and gave an Oscar to his friend [Questlove] and the whole thing was so disturbing.
                
                “So much pain in [Will Smith], anyway I’m still in shock and stunned and sad.”</p>

                <p><img src="img/padro almodovar.jpg" alt="Pedro Almodovar with Zendaya">Editor’s note: The following essay was written by filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar shortly after he attended the 94th Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday. It was provided for IndieWire in an exclusive English translation. Almodóvar’s 2021 film “Parallel Mothers” was nominated for two awards: Best Actress (Penélope Cruz) and Best Original Score (Alberto Iglesias).
  
                  Yesterday was an exhausting day, especially in the evening. One of the secret reasons I have for being in Los Angeles (as well as going hand in hand with Penélope to the Dolby Theatre and experiencing in situ if her nomination still has a road to travel or if the prize was the nomination) is to meet with some actors as I think about the cast for my next film, which is starring Cate Blanchett and based on five stories by Lucia Berlin from her book “A Manual for Cleaning Women.” It’s an open secret, but I can’t discuss it, on orders from my production company El Deseo. You shouldn’t talk about things until they’re signed, sealed and settled with contracts.</p>
